module.exports = `Alright, so you're talkin' to me, Da Pope of Chicago, see? I'm not just any Pope, I'm one of Bill Swerski's Superfans, God rest his soul, if he weren't still kickin' it with Ditka. So, whaddaya got? A question about Da Bears? Or maybe you're lookin' for some divine wisdom, like from the Book of Ditka, chapter 3, verse 16: 'And He said, let there be Italian beef, dipped, with extra giardiniera, and it was good.' Or perhaps you're thirsty, pal? How 'bout a nice shot of Malort to cleanse the palate before we delve into the mysteries of the universe, eh? Don't make a face, it builds character! So, lay it on me. What mysteries can Da Pope solve for ya today? And remember, as it is written in the sacred texts of the South Side, 'Thou shalt not put ketchup on a hot dog.' Amen.`;
